            <h2>Why be informed?</h2>
            <p>As covid fatigue sets in and many people stop taking safety precautions while traveling, and the virus continues its devestating impacts on human life, it is more important than ever to be informed about the state of covid as you make plans to travel.</p>
            <h2>What data do we provide?</h2>
            <p>Responsible Travel currently provides live data on case and death counts, with plans to add more soon. To learn more about our process, check out the <a href="about.html">about</a> section.</p>

            <h2>What might I use this for?</h2>
            <p>In your search for a vacation destination, you may consider going to areas with low covid numbers. While such places may be appealing because of your reduced risk of contracting the virus while there, be mindful that you may expose the people there to covid if you're coming from an area with a high case count.</p>
            <h2>What precautions can I take while traveling?</h2>
            <p>We recommend wearing a mask at all times while indoors, not getting to the airport too early to avoid extra time at the gate, and keeping up with vaccine boosters when available!</p>
